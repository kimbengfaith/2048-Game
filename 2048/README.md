     Intructions on how the game works

* The 2048 game is a game where by you combine numbers which are thesame by moving in the left,right,up and down directions.

* The aim is to add the numbers which are thesame in the 4x4 board until you uptain aleast a 2048 in one of the boxes on the board
  
At the start the game only 2 boxes are randomly filled with either a 2 or 4.

* To move the numbers in the board in the left,right,up and down directions, you need to enter the various letters 'l', 'r', 'u', and 'd' respectively.

* If a character other than the 4 characters above is entered, you would be notified that you have placed the wrong character and will be asked to continue playing by entering the right character.

* Each time you move the board in either of the 4 directions, a new number randomly appears on a empty box in the board.

* Finally you will only loose the game if all the boxes are filled with numbers and you dont have no possibility of merging the numbers again.

## Description

[
For the game to run succesfully we had to divide it into subsections and each of the subsections had to work successfully befor we went on to the next.

which were...
- creat the  board using a list of list and display it.
- Create functions that will merge the board in the left, right, up and down directions. We noticed that if we could successfully merge in a single direction (in our case it was the left) we can use reverse functions to merge in the right directions and transpose functions to merge in the up and down directions.
- Create an empty game board filled with 2 random values either a 2 or 4.
- Work on the directions.Like when the user enters an ' l ' the numbers in the board moves left and merges.
- Add a new value each time the you make a move.
- Set functions to check if the player has won or lost.
  

we had to import the random liberary to randomly place a number in into any box in the board and the copy the libary to check if the player has lost the game.

And we used fuctions functions to make the code less easier to understand and implement.
